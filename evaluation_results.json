It involves extending the foundation deeper or wider so that the load of the building is transferred to more stable soil or rock layers.\n\n### Why underpinning is needed\n- **Settlement**: If the ground beneath a building is soft or has been disturbed (e.g., by excavation, erosion, or changes in groundwater), the structure may settle unevenly.\n- **Foundation failure**: Existing foundations may be too shallow, too narrow, or made of unsuitable material for the current load.\n- **Renovation or extension**: Adding new loads (e.g., a new floor, a heavy roof) can exceed the capacity of the original foundation.\n- **Ground movement**: Nearby construction, mining, or natural events can shift the soil, threatening the stability of the building.\n\n### Common underpinning methods\n| Method | How it works | Typical use |\n|--------|--------------|-------------|\n| **Concrete underpinning (Cofferdam)** | A new concrete footing is poured below the existing foundation, often using a cofferdam to keep water out. | Deepening foundations in soft soils. |\n| **Piled underpinning** | Piles (concrete, steel, or timber) are driven or drilled into the ground to reach a stable layer, then the existing foundation is transferred onto them. | When the existing foundation is too shallow or the soil is too weak. |\n| **Beam and base underpinning** | A steel or concrete beam is placed under the existing foundation, and a new base (often concrete) is poured beneath it. | When the foundation needs to be raised or reinforced. |\n| **Micropile underpinning** | Very small-diameter piles are installed close together to support the foundation. | Tight spaces or when minimal disturbance is required. |\n| **Soil nailing** | Long, reinforced steel bars are driven into the soil to stabilize it, often used in retaining walls but can support foundations. | When the soil is unstable but not suitable for piles. |\n\n### Typical underpinning process\n1. **Assessment**: Geotechnical investigation to determine soil conditions and load requirements.\n2. **Design**: Engineers design the underpinning system (type, depth, spacing, materials).\n3. **Preparation**: Temporary shoring or bracing may be installed to support the building during work.\n4. **Construction**: The chosen underpinning method is executed, often in stages to keep the building stable.\n5. **Testing & Monitoring**: Load tests and settlement monitoring ensure the underpinning performs as expected.\n\n### Key considerations\n- **Safety**: Underpinning can be risky; proper shoring and monitoring are essential.\n- **Cost**: The method chosen depends on soil conditions, building size, and budget.\n- **Regulations**: Building codes and local regulations may dictate specific underpinning practices.\n\nIn short, underpinning is the process of reinforcing or extending an existing foundation to ensure a building remains stable and safe when the original foundation is inadequate for the current conditions or loads.",

    "question": "What is a mur manteau?",
    "agent_response": "**Mur\u202fmanteau** (literally \u201cmantle wall\u201d) is a construction technique used in the renovation of building envelopes, especially in France. It is a wall that \u201cwraps\u201d or \u201cmantles\u201d the existing wall, creating a new, more thermally\u2011efficient envelope around it.\n\n### How it works\n1. **Existing wall** \u2013 The original wall (brick, stone, concrete, etc.) remains in place.  \n2. **Cavity** \u2013 A gap is left or created between the old wall and the new outer layer.  \n3. **Insulation** \u2013 The cavity is filled with insulation material (mineral wool, expanded polystyrene, aerogel, etc.).  \n4. **Outer layer** \u2013 A new fa\u00e7ade is attached to the outer side of the cavity. This can be plasterboard, brick veneer, stone cladding, or any other finish material.  \n5. **Vapor barrier & ventilation** \u2013 A vapor\u2011resistant film and sometimes a ventilation layer are added to prevent condensation inside the cavity.\n\n### Why it\u2019s used\n- **Thermal performance** \u2013 Adds a significant amount of insulation without removing the original wall, reducing heat loss and improving energy efficiency.  \n- **Acoustic performance** \u2013 The cavity can also dampen sound transmission.  \n- **Moisture control** \u2013 Properly designed, it can prevent moisture from reaching the original wall.  \n- **Aesthetic flexibility** \u2013 The outer layer can be finished in a variety of styles, allowing for a modern look while preserving the historic character of the building.  \n- **Speed of installation** \u2013 It can be installed relatively quickly compared to full wall replacement.\n\n### Typical applications\n- **Energy\u2011retrofit of old buildings** \u2013 Common in France\u2019s \u201cr\u00e9habilitation thermique\u201d programs.  \n- **Renovation of historic fa\u00e7ades** \u2013 Allows for modern insulation while keeping the original fa\u00e7ade visible.  \n- **Interior wall upgrades** \u2013 Sometimes used inside to improve thermal comfort and acoustics.\n\n### Key design considerations\n- **Condensation risk** \u2013 The cavity must be ventilated or sealed with a vapor barrier to avoid moisture buildup.  \n- **Structural load** \u2013 The new outer layer must be light enough not to overload the existing wall.  \n- **Compatibility** \u2013 Materials chosen for the cavity and outer layer must be compatible with the existing wall\u2019s thermal and moisture properties.  \n- **Regulatory compliance** \u2013 Must meet local building codes and energy\u2011efficiency standards (e.g., French \u201cCode de la construction et de l\u2019habitation\u201d).\n\nIn short, a **mur manteau** is a \u201cmantle\u201d wall that adds insulation and a new fa\u00e7ade around an existing wall, improving thermal and acoustic performance while preserving the original structure.",

AI\u2011generated content that is not properly cited or transformed can be considered plagiarism or cheating.\n- **Learning outcomes**: The goal of the course is for you to understand the material. Using AI as a tool to *understand*\u2014not to *replace* your effort\u2014supports that goal.\n- **Citation**: If you incorporate AI\u2011generated text or code, cite it (e.g., \u201cGenerated with ChatGPT on 2025\u201112\u201108\u201d) or re\u2011write it in your own words.\n\n### Bottom line\n\nUsing AI as a *learning aid* (explaining concepts, generating practice questions, debugging code, etc.) is fine. Just make sure the final work you submit is your own, properly cited, and reflects your own understanding.",

    "question": "Are additional documents required for internships abroad?",
    "agent_response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe official IMT\u202fMines\u202fAl\u00e8s documents do not list any *extra* paperwork that is required **specifically** for an internship abroad. The same set of documents that you submit for a domestic internship (agreement, tutor contact, attendance log, etc.) applies.\n\n**What the FAQ says**\n\n- The FAQ for the Master Disaster Management program states that the mandatory 6\u2011month internship \u201ccan be completed in France or abroad\u201d (FAQ_SCHOOL.json.pdf, page\u202f3).  \n- No additional forms or documents are mentioned for the abroad option.\n\n**What you should still check**\n\nEven though the university\u2019s policy does not add extra paperwork, an internship abroad usually involves:\n\n| Typical requirement | Why it matters |\n|---------------------|----------------|\n| **Visa / residence permit** | Most countries require a work\u2011or\u2011study visa for interns. |\n| **Proof of funding / insurance** | Many host countries require evidence that you can support yourself and that you have health insurance. |\n| **Letter of invitation / host company agreement** | Some countries need a formal invitation from the host company. |\n| **Health & travel insurance** | Required by the host country or by the university\u2019s international office. |\n\nThese items are **not** listed in the university\u2019s internship policy, but they are standard for any overseas placement. It is best to:\n\n1. **Contact the International Office** at IMT\u202fMines\u202fAl\u00e8s for guidance on visa and insurance requirements.  \n2. **Ask the host company** for any documents they need (e.g., invitation letter, internship contract).  \n3. **Confirm with the university\u2019s internship coordinator** that the standard internship paperwork (agreement, tutor contact, attendance log, etc.) is sufficient for the abroad placement.\n\n**Bottom line**\n\n- **No extra university\u2011specific documents** are required for an abroad internship beyond the usual internship paperwork.  \n- **Additional documents** (visa, insurance, host\u2011company letter) may be needed, but those are governed by the host country\u2019s regulations and the host company\u2019s policies, not by IMT\u202fMines\u202fAl\u00e8s.",

    "question": "Do I need French social insurance for the university?",
    "agent_response": "**Short answer:**  \nYes \u2013 if you are studying in France, you must be covered by the French social\u2011security system (S\u00e9curit\u00e9\u202fSociale). This is required for access to the public health system, maternity benefits, and other social services that the university relies on.\n\n---\n\n### Why it matters\n\n| Reason | What it gives you |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| **Health coverage** | Access to public hospitals, GP visits, prescription drugs, and emergency care. |\n| **Maternity / parental leave** | Entitlement to paid leave and benefits if you become pregnant or have a child. |\n| **Accident & disability** | Compensation and support if you\u2019re injured or become disabled. |\n| **University services** | Many universities (including IMT\u202fMines\u202fAl\u00e8s) require proof of social\u2011security registration for enrollment, tuition payment, and access to campus health facilities. |\n\n---\n\n### How to get covered\n\n| Step | What to do | Typical timeline |\n|------|------------|------------------|\n| 1. **Register with the French social\u2011security system** | \u2022 If you\u2019re a **EU/EEA** student, you can use your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) for the first 6\u202fmonths. After that, you must register for the French system. <br>\u2022 If you\u2019re a **non\u2011EU** student, you must register immediately after arriving in France. | Within the first month of arrival. |\n| 2. **Provide proof of enrollment** | The university will ask for a copy of your enrollment certificate or student ID. | At the time of registration. |\n| 3. **Pay the contribution** | \u2022 EU students: usually a small monthly fee (\u2248\u202f\u20ac3\u2013\u20ac5). <br>\u2022 Non\u2011EU students: a higher fee (\u2248\u202f\u20ac30\u2013\u20ac40/month) plus a one\u2011time registration fee. | Monthly, automatically deducted from your bank account. |\n| 4. **Get your Carte\u202fVitale** | The card is your health\u2011insurance card. It\u2019s issued by the **Assurance Maladie** and is needed to claim reimbursements. | 2\u20134\u202fweeks after registration. |\n| 5. **Check your coverage** | Verify that your **Carte\u202fVitale** is active and that you\u2019re listed as a student. | After receiving the card. |\n\n---\n\n### Practical tips for IMT\u202fMines\u202fAl\u00e8s\n\n| What to do | Where to get help |\n|------------|-------------------|\n| **Ask the International Office** | They can guide you through the registration process and provide the necessary forms. |\n| **Use the university\u2019s student health plan** | Some universities offer a supplementary student health insurance plan (often called \u201cMutuelle \u00c9tudiante\u201d). It can cover costs not reimbursed by the public system. |\n| **Keep documentation** | Store a copy of your registration confirmation, Carte\u202fVitale, and any correspondence with the Assurance Maladie. You may need to show this to the university or to your employer if you do a work\u2011study. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Yes, you need French social insurance** if you\u2019re studying at IMT\u202fMines\u202fAl\u00e8s.  \n- EU students can start with the EHIC and then register for the French system.  \n- Non\u2011EU students must register immediately and pay the required contributions.  \n- The university will ask for proof of registration, so be sure to complete the process as soon as you arrive.  \n\nIf you have any doubts, contact the **International Office** or the **Student Services** at IMT\u202fMines\u202fAl\u00e8s \u2013 they\u2019ll walk you through the exact paperwork and deadlines.",

This lets you set the correct austenitising, quenching, and tempering temperatures. |\n| **Understand solidification and casting behaviour** | It shows the liquidus and solidus lines, so you know at what temperature the alloy starts to solidify and when it becomes fully solid. This is critical for casting, welding, and additive manufacturing. |\n| **Predict mechanical properties** | The phases present (and their distribution) determine hardness, strength, ductility, and toughness. By selecting a composition that lies in a particular region of the diagram, you can tailor these properties. |\n| **Diagnose microstructural problems** | If a part shows unexpected brittleness or porosity, the phase diagram can help identify whether the wrong phase or an unwanted intermetallic formed. |\n| **Support thermodynamic modelling** | Modern alloy design tools (CALPHAD, Thermo\u2011Calc) use phase diagrams as the basis for calculating phase equilibria, phase fractions, and thermodynamic properties. |\n\n**Bottom line**\n\nPhase diagrams are the *map* of a metal or alloy\u2019s phase space.
